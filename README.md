Learn how easy it is to code and run a notebook using Azure resources and Python

In this repository, I have built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting the bank customer churn using python notebook and Microsoft Azure services. Please note that there is a lot Azure Machine Learning (ML) provides and in this article, Iâ€™ll demonstrate how easy it is to code and run a notebook using Azure resources and python.

This repository is part of Medium article published under "Towards Data Science" publication.
